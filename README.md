Game Functionality:
The game follows a typical platformer game structure. The player can control a character using arrow keys or 'W, A, D' keys or arrow keys to move and jump. The player can collect items and traverse different levels represented by changing background images. There's also a background music track that plays throughout the game.

In terms of gameplay, the game includes multiple levels and a collectible item that becomes available in the final level.

Overall, this code represents the foundation of a simple 2D platformer game with an introduction screen, gameplay mechanics, and level progression. The JavaScript files are well-organized, and the game loop ensures smooth gameplay.
